        and overall integration of the Python Programmers' Community in Czech Republic
        and surrounding area, popularisation of new applications of the language as

        PyCon CZ events are also fantastic networking opportunities and a great

      <h2 id="the-short-version">Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The conference is addressed to all Python programmers, experienced and novices
        alike. Presentations will cover a wide range of topics relevant to students,
        professionals, and hobbyists. Women who are interested to learn more about
        Python can also participate in DjangoGirls. Altogether, we are expecting more than
        400 participants this year. The majority are likely to be Czech locals. With Brno and Czech
        Republic so centrally located in EU though, and the fact that the Czech organizer

        Austria, Poland, Germany, Hungary, UK and more as well.
